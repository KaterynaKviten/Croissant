      For those who find mornings to be a bit of a struggle, Einstein Bros. is
      making things a little easier with its new Croissant Deluxe Sandwich.
      Stuffed with all your favorite breakfast foods, the new dish will perk you
      upâ€”no matter how tired you may be. The new Croissant Deluxe Sandwich from
      Einstein Bros. is an elevated take on a traditional breakfast sandwich.
      The dish consists of a flaky butter croissant stuffed with bacon,
      fresh-cracked eggs, and a slice of cheddar cheese. In other words, it's
      like an entire breakfast meal that you can enjoy on the go. If croissants
      aren't your thing, there's also the new Chorizo & Pepper Jack Sandwich,
      which is made with a spicy chorizo patty and served on a hearty Einstein
      Bros. egg bagel.
